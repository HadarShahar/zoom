# zoom
Zoom project - still under development...

So far I have made the following features, all of them work between multiple users:
- Video streaming (UDP)
- Audio streaming (UDP)
- Screen sharing  (UDP)

- Chat: broadcast messages and direct messages to specific users
- Painting on a smart board, which also detects lines and rectangles
- Writing in a "remote" window (currently notepad, reflects the text that each user writes to all the others)
